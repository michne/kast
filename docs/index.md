description: Install Kast, start a workspace runtime, and run the supported
  Kotlin analysis flow through the repo-local CLI.
icon: lucide/network
---

Kast has one supported operator path: run the repo-local `kast` command
against the workspace you want to analyze. These pages focus on the flow that
works today: install the CLI, ensure a workspace runtime, run analysis
commands, and stop the runtime when you are done. The installer can also offer
to wire Bash or Zsh completions into your shell init file while it sets up the
launcher.

!!! note
    The current supported flow does not advertise `callHierarchy` yet.

## Start with the page that matches your goal

This short doc set is organized around the jobs people usually need to do
first.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   __Get started__

    ---

    Install the published CLI, start a workspace runtime, and verify that the
    workspace is ready for analysis.

    [Open the guide](get-started.md)

-   __Command reference__

    ---

    Keep the public command list, key options, and support boundaries nearby
    while you work.

    [Open the guide](command-reference.md)

-   __Run analysis commands__

    ---

    Use the common read and mutation commands with examples that stay close to
    the current CLI surface.

    [Open the guide](run-analysis-commands.md)

-   __Use Kast from an LLM agent__

    ---

    Start with conversational requests like "find references to
    `HealthCheckService`" and let the packaged `kast` skill bridge the lookup.

## Advanced prompting

Most readers do not need to think about offsets, request payloads, or raw
command reproduction. If you are authoring automation or debugging how the
skill maps a human reference into the CLI, use the advanced scaffolding page
after the human-first guide.

## What every Kast command has in common

Kast stays consistent across commands so you can move between tasks without
relearning the interface.

- Run `kast --help` for the grouped command overview. In interactive terminals,
  the help page uses ANSI color.
- Use `--key=value` syntax for command options.
- Pass absolute paths for `--workspace-root`, `--file-path`, and
  `--request-file`.
- Expect successful results as machine-readable JSON on stdout.
- Expect daemon lifecycle notes, when present, on stderr.
- Keep Java 21 or newer available on your path or under `JAVA_HOME`.
- Let the installer enable Bash or Zsh completions if you want tab completion
  immediately.

## A typical Kast session

Most sessions follow the same short loop, even when the specific analysis task
changes.

1. Install the published CLI with the copyable installer or `./install.sh`
   from a checkout, and enable shell completion if the installer offers it.
2. Open `kast --help` to confirm the grouped command view and your first
   completion-enabled shell.
3. Start or reuse a workspace runtime with `kast workspace ensure`.
4. Inspect `kast capabilities`, then run the analysis command you need.
5. Stop the workspace daemon with `kast daemon stop` when you are done.

## Next steps

If you are new to Kast, start with the guided setup page. If you already have a
running workspace daemon, jump straight to the task and reference pages.
