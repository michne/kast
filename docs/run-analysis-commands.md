  runtime is ready.

Once `kast workspace ensure` has selected a ready daemon, you can run the
supported analysis commands through the same CLI. This page focuses on the
common tasks people reach for during normal workspace analysis. If you are
starting from a human description of a class or property instead of a known
file position, move to the [human-first agent
guide](use-kast-from-an-llm-agent.md) first.

## Choose inline options or a request file

Most analysis commands support two ways to provide input. Inline flags are
fast for ad hoc work. Request files are better when the payload is richer or
you want to save it for repeatable automation.

| Command | Inline input | Request file input | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `symbol resolve` | `--file-path` and `--offset` | `--request-file` | Use the inline form for a single lookup |
| `references` | `--file-path`, `--offset`, and optional `--include-declaration=true` | `--request-file` | Keep `--include-declaration` off unless you need the declaration in the result |
| `diagnostics` | `--file-paths=/absolute/A.kt,/absolute/B.kt` | `--request-file` | Inline input is easiest for a small list of files |
| `rename` | `--file-path`, `--offset`, `--new-name`, and optional `--dry-run=true` | `--request-file` | Rename stays in planning mode unless you change `dryRun` in the query |
| `edits apply` | Not supported | `--request-file` | The request file must include edits plus expected file hashes |

## Check capabilities before you rely on a feature

Capabilities are the contract for what the current runtime is willing to do.
Check them first when you switch workspaces or when automation depends on a
specific operation being available.

```bash
kast \
  capabilities \
  --workspace-root=/absolute/path/to/workspace
```

If a capability is missing, Kast rejects the command instead of pretending the
runtime supports it.

## Resolve a symbol

Use `symbol resolve` when you know a file position and want the symbol details
at that exact offset.

```bash
kast \
  symbol resolve \
  --workspace-root=/absolute/path/to/workspace \
  --file-path=/absolute/path/to/src/main/kotlin/com/example/App.kt \
  --offset=123
```

Use a request file when the calling code already knows how to serialize a
`SymbolQuery` payload.

## Find references

Use `references` when you want usage sites for the symbol at a specific file
position.

```bash
kast \
  references \
  --workspace-root=/absolute/path/to/workspace \
  --file-path=/absolute/path/to/src/main/kotlin/com/example/App.kt \
  --offset=123 \
  --include-declaration=true
```

Keep `--include-declaration=true` for the cases where your consumer wants the
declaration returned alongside the reference list.

## Run diagnostics

Use `diagnostics` when you want current diagnostics for one or more files in
the workspace.

```bash
kast \
  diagnostics \
  --workspace-root=/absolute/path/to/workspace \
  --file-paths=/absolute/path/to/src/main/kotlin/com/example/App.kt
```

Move to `--request-file` when you want the calling side to control the payload
shape directly.

## Plan a rename

Use `rename` when you want an edit plan for a symbol rename. The inline form is
usually enough for ad hoc work.

```bash
kast \
  rename \
  --workspace-root=/absolute/path/to/workspace \
  --file-path=/absolute/path/to/src/main/kotlin/com/example/App.kt \
  --offset=123 \
  --new-name=RenamedSymbol
```

The inline command defaults to `--dry-run=true`, so the result stays in
planning mode unless your request payload says otherwise.

## Apply a prepared edit plan

Use `edits apply` only after you already have a prepared edit plan that
includes the edits and expected file hashes.

```bash
kast \
  edits apply \
  --workspace-root=/absolute/path/to/workspace \
  --request-file=/absolute/path/to/query.json
```

This command does not support inline flags for the payload. It must read the
request from a file.

## Know the current gap

The supported CLI path still does not advertise `callHierarchy`. Plan around
that gap until the capability appears in `kast capabilities`.

## Next steps

Keep the reference page nearby when you want a smaller lookup-oriented summary
of the public commands.
