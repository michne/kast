This page is the compact lookup guide for the public `kast` commands. It
stays focused on the supported CLI surface rather than the internal daemon
entrypoint.

## Global help and command syntax

The top-level commands keep the interface predictable, which matters when you
switch between manual use and automation.

| Command | Use it for | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kast help` | Print the full command list | Use `kast help <topic>` for a narrower help page |
| `kast --help` | Print the same top-level help page | Useful in scripts that prefer flags |
| `kast --version` | Print the CLI version | `kast version` also works |
| `kast completion <bash\|zsh>` | Print an opt-in shell completion script | Supports Bash and Zsh |

Every option uses `--key=value` syntax. Successful commands print JSON on
stdout. Daemon notes, when present, print on stderr after the command.

When Kast detects an interactive terminal, the help pages use ANSI color. If
you need color in another context, set `CLICOLOR_FORCE=1` before you run the
help command.

## Workspace lifecycle commands

Use these commands to inspect, start, reuse, and stop the standalone daemon
for one workspace.

| Command | Purpose | Key options | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `workspace status` | Inspect registered descriptors, liveness, and readiness | `--workspace-root` | Reports the selected daemon plus any additional descriptors for the same workspace |
| `workspace ensure` | Reuse a ready daemon or start one | `--workspace-root`, `--wait-timeout-ms` | Uses a `60000` millisecond wait timeout unless you override it |
| `daemon start` | Start a detached standalone daemon explicitly | `--workspace-root`, `--wait-timeout-ms` | Useful when you want a direct start instead of an ensure |
| `daemon stop` | Stop the selected standalone daemon | `--workspace-root` | Removes the selected descriptor and reports what stopped |

## Read commands

Use these commands when you want read-only analysis against a ready workspace
runtime.

| Command | Purpose | Input shape | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `capabilities` | Print the runtime capability set | `--workspace-root`, optional `--wait-timeout-ms` | Use this before relying on an operation in automation |
| `symbol resolve` | Resolve the symbol at a file position | Inline flags or `--request-file` | Inline form needs `--file-path` and `--offset` |
| `references` | Find references for the symbol at a file position | Inline flags or `--request-file` | Inline form also supports `--include-declaration=true` |
| `diagnostics` | Run diagnostics for one or more files | Inline flags or `--request-file` | Inline form uses comma-separated absolute file paths |

## Mutation commands

Use these commands when you want Kast to produce or apply code edits through
the supported mutation flow.

| Command | Purpose | Input shape | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `rename` | Plan a rename operation | Inline flags or `--request-file` | Inline form needs `--file-path`, `--offset`, and `--new-name` |
| `edits apply` | Apply a prepared edit plan | `--request-file` only | The request file must include edits and expected file hashes |

## Current support boundary

The public command surface is intentionally small. Today, the main remaining
product gap is `callHierarchy`, so you must not assume it is available until
the runtime advertises it in `capabilities`.
